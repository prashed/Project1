<p style="font-size:30px">With the new age of Internet search and search engines becoming more advanced and companies advertising their products on the Internet, e-commerce was just getting started. The obsession with shopping became more conspicuous and this was the evolution of capitalism. Companies we know today like Amazon and eBay harness the power of Internet traffic and both companies offered a solution to buying and selling merchandise with ease. </p>
<br/>
<p style="font-size:30px">Jeff Bezos the founder of Amazon originally created it to be a bookstore with this new technology also came obstacles like actually purchasing from the website. Customers at first did not trust this new technology because to purchase a product from the website you needed to enter your credit card information which seemed risky to customers because their credit card information could be stolen. To combat this obstacle, Woodfield Diffey, Martin Helman, and Ralph Merkel created a solution called public key cryptography which encrypted the information so customers could share their information confidentially on e-commerce websites.</p>
