<p style="font-size:30px">With the connectivity the Internet offered it also introduced a new way for people to communicate. Companies like Facebook, YouTube and other social media platforms were just getting started. YouTube broke the stereotype of having important people or people of status to appear in the media they offered a platform where any person with Internet access can broadcast themselves to everyone in the world. This new age brought power to the people with videos being broadcasted by anyone. The playing field was levelled between regular people and media companies in reaching an audience.

<p style="font-size:30px">A new invention came about when obtaining music wasn’t very productive in the 1990s the invention of the MP3 allowed consumers to listen to music by uploading it on a device which then they could attach to headphones and listen to music. This simple and easy way to listen to music took the music industry by surprise. Record label companies soon put copyright laws on their music and gave no permission for online websites to upload and download their music. This idea of downloading music for free was already too mainstream and people couldn’t care less about the copyright laws. One of these websites was Napster, A lawsuit against Napster forbade them from allowing consumers to download MP3 files and eventually the website was shut down for infringing those rights.
