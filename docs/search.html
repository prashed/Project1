<p style="font-size:30px">Until now navigating the web was nearly impossible. The Internet had long pages of information and finding what you needed was difficult. This introduced an uproar of young computer science entrepreneurs that founded companies like Yahoo and Excite and made them extremely wealthy in the process. The Internet search first started When Jerry Yang and David Filer, the founders of yahoo wanted to find information about a basketball game.</p>
<br/>
<p style="font-size:30px">The two young entrepreneurs still had no way to generate revenue off of their search engine and to counter that they advertise banners on their website and the advertising companies would pay them for the traffic they produce. This is when yahoo showed everyone but it was possible to make money off of the Internet. This started an Internet search frenzy since people previously thought it was impossible to make money off the web. With the help of Bill Gross, a new company which we now know as the infamous Google, Gross solved the riddle of Internet advertising.</p>
